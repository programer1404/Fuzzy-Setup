/**
 The Activation class is the abstract class for RuleBlock activation methods. An
 activation method implements the criteria to activate the rules within a given
 rule block. An activation method needs to process every rule and determine
 whether the rule is to be activated or deactivated. The activation methods were
 first introduced in version 6.0, but in earlier versions the term `activation`
 referred to the TNorm that modulated the consequent of a rule, which is now
 referred to as the `implication` operator.
