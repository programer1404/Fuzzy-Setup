/**
 The Term class is the abstract class for linguistic terms. The linguistic terms
 in this library can be divided in four groups as: `basic`, `extended`, `edge`,
 and `function`. The `basic` terms are Triangle, Trapezoid, Rectangle, and
 Discrete. The `extended` terms are Bell, Binary, Cosine, Gaussian,
 GaussianProduct, PiShape, SigmoidDifference, SigmoidProduct, and Spike. The
 `edge` terms are Concave, Ramp, Sigmoid, SShape, and ZShape. The `function`
 terms are Constant, Linear, and Function.

 In the figure below, the `basic` terms are represented in the first column, and
 the `extended` terms in the second and third columns. The `edge` terms are
 represented in the fifth and sixth rows, and the `function` terms in the last
 row.
